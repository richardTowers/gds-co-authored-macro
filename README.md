Co-authored macro
=================

Put this in your vimrc:

```
let @a='ICo-authored-by: ly$A <@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>F@Pva<guf r.'
```

Then you can expand a name into a co-authored line by pressing @a in normal mode, like so:

In:

```
Richard Towers
```

Out:

```
Co-authored-by: Richard Towers <richard.towers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>
```
